= Overview



An enhanced date select form helper that allows you to use the full {HTML spec}[http://www.w3.org/TR/html5] for date_select helper methods from rails. This is more than what you get with the
default Rails date select helper because it can allow values to persist in dropdowns even if you submit a invalid value.

= Features

* Fully customizable HTML5 attributes for date_select .

= Requirements

1. {Ruby 1.9.x}[http://www.ruby-lang.org]
2. {Ruby on Rails}[http://rubyonrails.org].

= Setup

Type the following from the command line to install:

  gem install enhanced_date_select

Add the following to your Gemfile:

  gem "enhanced_date_select"

= Usage

Use the +enhanced_date_select+ instead of +date_select+ helper
methods in your views. Example:

  <%= form_for @post do |form| %>
        <div >
        <%= form.enhanced_date_select :birthday, { :prompt => {
            :day => "please select one",
            :month => "please select one",
            :year => "please select one" },
          :value => {:year => @year, :month => @month, :day => @day},
          :order => [:day, :month, :year],
          :start_year => Time.now.year,
          :end_year => 1940 }, { :class => "input_3cols" } %>
      </div>
  <% end %>

...or alternatively:

  <%= form_for @post do |form| %>
      <div >
        <%= form.date_select :birthday, { :prompt => {
            :day => "please select one",
            :month => "please select one",
            :year => "please select one" },
          :value => Date.new(2011,02,01),
          :order => [:day, :month, :year],
          :start_year => Time.now.year,
          :end_year => 1940 }, { :class => "input_3cols" } %>
      </div>
  <% end %>

The +enhanced_date_select+ takes all the standard options as the default Rails date_select
method. The only difference is that it expects an hash with values for year, month and day instead of an date object.

= Testing

To test, do the following:

1. cd to the gem root.
2. bundle install
3. bundle exec rake
